Covers the basic use of dynamic templates (hbs)
  - loading hbs file with .render
  - hbs files syntax
  - use of partials (reutilization of the same template on different templates)
  - use of helpers (pre-made functions that can be called on templates)
    - the syntax for calling functions in templates is the same as when calling properties ({{function_name/property_name}})
    - hbs checks always first for a function and only then for a property
    - when calling a helper with arguments, the syntax is the following: {{helperMethod arg1 arg2 ...}}
  - use of middleware functions (app.use)
    - can be specified with a path (use('/path', callback))
    - the argument 'next' on callback function is a method that, when called, continues the request to next lines
  - generating SSH keys and adding to github
    - https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/
    - adding ssh key to heroku:
      - heroku keys:add
      - heroky keys (prints current keys)
      - ssh -v git@heroku.com
  - heroku will always check package.json for a script named 'start' when deploying the app
    - This script must contain the terminal command that start the app
