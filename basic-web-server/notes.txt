Covers the basic use of dynamic templates (hbs)
  - loading hbs file with .render
  - hbs files syntax
  - use of partials (reutilization of the same template on different templates)
  - use of helpers (pre-made functions that can be called on templates)
    - the syntax for calling functions in templates is the same as when calling properties ({{function/property}})
    - hbs checks always first for a function and only then for a property
    - when calling a helper with arguments, the syntax is the following: {{helperMethod arg1 arg2 ...}}
